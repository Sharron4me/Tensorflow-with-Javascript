Sorry for the server speed as it was the only one avaliable for free ;-)

Made With HTML , Javascript and Tensorflow JS 

### Why Javascript?

Because Javascript is a client side language, it will not consume server cpu power at all and hence all the execution will take place on client machine rather than server.
